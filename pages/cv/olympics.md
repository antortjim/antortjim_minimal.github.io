The mathematical olympics is a 14 year old students contest organised by the Andalusian Society for Mathematical Education (SAEM) THALES. Antonio participated on the 2008 edition. Students were asked to solve a series of exercises, whose focus was on logic and intuition, rather than actual mathematics. That is, thinking hard to find the problem with basic mathematics skills was preffered over advanced mathematics knowledge.
There was a provincial edition, and a joint regional edition, besides an edition run at national (Spanish) level.

Antonio Ortega was one of the students from Huelva qualified for the regional olympics, held at Ja√©n one month later. Besides, he won an award called 'Paco Anillo', for having proposed a smart answer to one of the problems posed.
