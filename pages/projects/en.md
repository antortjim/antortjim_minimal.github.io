### Original work ###

These projects comprise either extended analysis of published works, or  completely independent work.

* [Bioinformatics and Genomic Analysis final exam](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/EXAM/examen.pdf) consisting of 2 parts:
 
   1. Extended ChIP-seq analysis for prediction of PIF1 and PIF4 interaction in *A. thaliana*
   2. RNA-seq *de novo* analysis of early and late embrionary states in *X. tropicalis* using edgeR.

* [Bachelor Thesis](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/TFG/tfg.pdf), entitled "Caracterización de la proteína All1873" (in Spanish).

* [Structural Bioinformatics final exam](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/rmsd_nmers/protein.pdf). Students were asked to implement a Python pipeline to compute RMSD distributions on 5-mer peptides and interpret the results. Code  available at [Github](https://github.com/antortjim/structural_bioinformatics).

* [Statistics for e-Science work](https://antortjim.github.io/posts/2016/12/21/ioslides-and-Shiny-apps-showcase.html), a ioslides presentation and Shiny apps developed as part of the weekly exercises in this subject at KU.

### Replicates of previously published scientific works ###

The projects below are just replicates of the published computational analysis carried out by other scientists. Thus, despite there might be minor differences, the bulk of the creation is *not* my own original work. Reference to the scientific article projects are based on may be found in the *references* section.
