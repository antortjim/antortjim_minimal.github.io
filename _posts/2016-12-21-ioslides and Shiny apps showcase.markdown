[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a powerful web framework for running [R](https://www.r-project.org/)  code and generating awesome visualizations.

In this page you may see a showcase of my work in Statistics and e-Science at University of Copenhagen. As part of the weekly work in the subject, the students were asked to do some exercises using R. The solution to 4 of them is provided in the form of ioslides and Shiny apps.

[The slides](https://antortjim.shinyapps.io/exercise_4_app) are served by the shinyapps.io server at RStudio. (It takes a few second to load)


Below you may look at the built-in shiny apps:

The neuron dataset is available [here](http://math.ku.dk/~tfb525/teaching/statbe/neuronspikes.txt)

The code used to build the slides and the Shiny apps can be found in [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/antortjim/stats_week4/)
