PDB files contain a lot of information and reveal interesting statistics about proteins. In this project, the rmsd values of n-mer fragments coming from a 100 proteins database are computed. Notably, the RMSD values followed a clearly different distribution depending on whether or not the fragment sequences were the same, or not.

The PDF report can be downloaded  [here](http://people.binf.ku.dk/rnq313/rmsd_nmers/protein.pdf).

The python code is available [in Github](https://github.com/antortjim/structural_bioinformatics).
