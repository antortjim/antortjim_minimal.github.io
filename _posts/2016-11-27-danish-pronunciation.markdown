**Hvordan g√•r det?**

The Danish language can be very difficult to listen to, given the disparity between the written and spoken language.
However difficult learning a given language is, having a database of spoken words is very useful  for learning it.

I created a programme that downloads pronunciation files for Danish words. It can retrieve them from [ Den Danske Ordbog](http://ordnet.dk/ddo) and from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page).
These audio files can be used in conjunction with language learning software such as Anki.
